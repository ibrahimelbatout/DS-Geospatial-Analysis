# DS-Geospatial-Analysis
# Palestine Geospatial Analysis

This repository contains a geospatial analysis of the road networks in Gaza, the West Bank, and the combined regions, using Python's OSMnx library. This project was inspired by Ivan and marks a significant step in applying the geospatial knowledge I've gained during my Data Science journey with ALX Africa.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into three main parts:

1. **Gaza Analysis**: Focuses on the road networks within the Gaza Strip.
2. **West Bank Analysis**: Covers the road networks in the West Bank.
3. **Combined Analysis**: Merges both regions into a single geospatial analysis.

### Key Features

- **Dynamic Region Subdivision**: The code subdivides large geographical regions into manageable chunks, ensuring efficient processing.
- **Efficient Data Handling**: Implements garbage collection to manage memory effectively during large-scale data processing.
- **Visualization**: Generates detailed, symbolic maps that convey both data and deeper messages, reflecting the current situation on the ground.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Palestine-Geospatial-Analysis.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Palestine-Geospatial-Analysis
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Each folder contains code specific to the analysis of Gaza, the West Bank, and the combined regions. You can run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts independently:

## Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by Milan Janosov and driven by a desire to use data science for meaningful causes. 
The visualization serves as a stark reminder of the tragic events in Palestine, with red lines representing the bloodshed on the ground.
